        <h2>From My Heart To Yours</h2>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>To Ghislaine,</p>
            <p>My love, my heart, my darling, Ohemaa, my baby. From my heart to yours.</p>
            <p>You asked me how much I love you the other night and I told you words could not describe the love in my heart for you; which was and is still true, but I will try regardless.</p>
            <p>Although I don’t remember exactly how we met, for as long as I remember, I knew you would be a huge part of my life, but in what way I was still uncertain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>We became close..then we became distant but everyday since, I thought of you in some way shape or form; how were you doing? What you were up to in life? Did you ever think about me? Why were you on my mind? Do these people I’m around even compare to you? Would we ever be as close as we were again?</p>
            <p>In the moment it felt like wishful thinking. But God!</p>
            <p>Little did I know, God had a big plan up His sleeve. Being back in Sheffield from uni had me feeling very gloomy, from being 5 minutes away from the people I’d built great friendships with to being on the other side of the country in a matter of hours was tough to grasp. I genuinely felt alone.. until I remembered you, as I did every once in a while.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>However this time was different… we were both in the same city and we both seemed kinda bored just working/doing uni. Why not try and get back in her life as a friend? I thought to myself…but “What if it’s not the same?”, “she's probably a completely different person now”, “how do I know we’ll even click like we used to?”</p>
            <p>These were all the thoughts plaguing my overthinking mind as I contemplated getting back in contact with you. I decided the worst that can happen is that I realize it indeed was just wishful thinking and maybe you weren’t meant to be a part of my life after all.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>But I put that fear to the back of my mind and planted a seed “I swear there’s nobody in Sheffield anymore…” and I thank God every day that you responded with “I’m here.” We planned to go to the board game cafe and I was genuinely so excited to see you again after so long…but as friends of course…</p>
            <p>In all honesty, the moment I first laid eyes on you, I realized that God had answered a prayer my heart had unknowingly been praying since the day we parted ways.</p>
            <p>In that moment I felt relief, I felt joy, I felt peace, I felt a yearning for you but most importantly I felt like I was right where I was meant to be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>We met up a few more times after that and all those feelings I felt the first time; some still indescribable by words, seemed to grow each time and eventually I couldn’t distinguish between them, they’d become one emotion…love.</p>
            <p>Each time I saw you, the time I was willing to spend without you grew shorter and shorter until the day came where I told you how I truly feel and just as God had planned, you told me you feel the same!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>Now fast forward to today and I can say I have never come across anybody more caring, more compassionate, more supportive, more understanding, more beautiful, more intellectually stimulating, more funny, more warm, more sexy, more elegant and more like home in my entire life.</p>
            <p>I could use words to say how much I love you but I believe actions speak louder and I plan to use every loving day to express my love for you my baby.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="letter-page">
            <p>I never believed I would find my soulmate and get married and have kids, I never found anyone that made that picture clear enough, but you came, and you turned that picture into a 4K movie, starring you and I, a movie I can’t wait to watch unfold, and a movie I will cherish every second of as long as there is breath in my lungs.</p>
            <p>I say all that to say this…now that I’ve got you back in my life, I plan on holding you so close that we become indistinguishable, and this is the first step of my master plan… Ghislaine Uwayo…</p>
